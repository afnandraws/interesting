Notes - Backend
- first time building it, understanding routes. have previous experience working in change management performing updates
- use of Postman to test the API routes adn requests as well as error handling
- GET, POST, DELETE requests
- Managing app-wide state using Redux-Toolkit
- Using localStorage to persist state across reloads
 
Notes - Problems
- LocalStorage is not defined (on-recoverable-error)
- Save/Unsave function works however on reload, save/unsave is reset and that means someone could technically save the same post multiple times
- I would make it better by using Neo4J/GraphQL. This is because they allow you to define the relationship between data as well as the data itself
- Never got to implement the 'verified functionality.'
